  This software contains a parser combinator library for the OCaml lang-
  uage. It is intended to be used in conjunction with pa_ocaml (an OCaml
  parser and syntax extention mechanism) to provide  a  fully-integrated
  way of building parsers using an extention of OCaml's syntax.

(** This library implements a representation of grammar with semantical action.
    A  semantical  action is a value returned  as result of parsing. Parsing is
    performed  by  compiling   the grammar  to  combinators implemented  in the
    [Combinator]  module.  This library offers  "scanner less" parsing, but the
    [Lex] module provide a notion of terminals and blanks which allows for easy
    way to write grammars. *)

(** type of a grammar with semantical action of type ['a ].*)
type 'a grammar
type 'a t = 'a grammar

(** [print_grammar ch g] prints the grammar [g] of the given output channel.
    if [def=false] (the default is [true]) it will print the transformed
    grammar prior to compilation. *)
val print_grammar : ?def:bool -> out_channel -> 'a grammar -> unit

(** [fail ()] is a grammar that parses nothing (always fails) *)
val fail : unit -> 'a grammar

(** [empty a] accepts the empty input and returns [a] *)
val empty : 'a -> 'a grammar

(** [term t] accepts the terminal [t] and returns its semantics.
    See module [Lex] *)
val term : ?name:string -> 'a Lex.terminal -> 'a grammar

(** [appl g f] parses with [g] and apply [f] to the resulting semantics *)
val appl : ?name:string -> 'a grammar -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b grammar

(** [alt g1 g2] parses with [g1] and if it fails then [g2] *)
val alt : 'a grammar -> 'a grammar -> 'a grammar

(** [seq g1 g2 f] parse with g1 and then with g2 for the rest of the input, uses [f]
    to combine both semantics *)
val seq : 'a grammar -> 'b grammar -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> 'c grammar

(** usefull derivations from [seq] *)
val seq1 : 'a grammar -> 'b grammar -> 'a grammar
val seq2 : 'a grammar -> 'b grammar -> 'b grammar
val seqf : 'a grammar -> ('a -> 'b) grammar -> 'b grammar

(** [dseq g1 g2 f)] is a dependant sequence, the grammar [g2] used after [g1] may
    depend upon the semantics of [g1]. This is not very efficient as the grammar
    [g2] must be compiled at parsing time. It is a good idea to memoize [g2] *)
val dseq : 'a grammar -> ('a -> 'b grammar) -> ('b -> 'c) -> 'c grammar

(** [lpos g] is identical to [g] but passes the position just before parsing with
    [g] to the semantical action of [g] *)
val lpos : (Lex.pos -> 'a) grammar -> 'a grammar

(** [rpos g] is identical to [g] but passes the position just after parsing with
    [g] to the semantical action of [g] *)
val rpos : (Lex.pos -> 'a) grammar -> 'a grammar

(** [cache g] avoid to parse twice the same input with g by memoizing the result
    of the first parsing. Using [cache] allows to recover a polynomial complexity *)
val cache : 'a grammar -> 'a grammar

(** to define recursive grammars, one may declare the grammar first and then
    gives its value.
    [declare_grammar name] creates an undefined grammar with the given name *)
val declare_grammar : string -> 'a grammar

(** [set_grammar g1 g2] set the value of [g1] declared with [declare_grammar].
    will raise [Invalid_argument] if [g1] was not defined using
    [declare_grammar] or if it was already set.*)
val set_grammar : 'a grammar -> 'a grammar -> unit

(** [fixpoint g] compute the fixpoint of [g], that is a grammar [g0] such that
    [g0 = g g0] *)
val fixpoint : ?name:string -> ('a grammar -> 'a grammar) -> 'a grammar

(** [layout g b] changes the blank function to parse the input with the
    grammar [g]. The optional parameters allow to control which blanks are used
    at the bounndary. Both can be used in which case the new blanks are used
    second before parsing with [g] and first after. *)
val layout : ?old_before:bool -> ?new_before:bool ->
             ?new_after:bool -> ?old_after:bool ->
             'a grammar -> Lex.blank -> 'a grammar

(** [compile g] produces a combinator that can be used to actually do the parsing
    see the [Combinator] module *)
val compile : 'a grammar -> 'a Combinator.t

(** [grammar_info g] returns [(b,cs)] where [b] is true is the grammar accepts
    the empty input and where [cs] is the characters set accepted at the beginnning
    of the input. *)
val grammar_info : 'a grammar -> bool * Charset.t

(** gives the grammar name *)
val grammar_name : 'a grammar -> string

(** [grammar_family to_str name] returns a pair [(gs, set_gs)], where [gs]
    is a finite family of grammars parametrized by a value of type ['a]. A name
    [name] is to be provided for the family, and an optional function [to_str]
    can be provided to print the parameter and display better error messages. *)
val grammar_family : ?param_to_string:('a -> string) -> string
  -> ('a -> 'b grammar) * (('a -> 'b grammar) -> unit)

(**
   {[
   (* Declare the grammar family *)
   let (gr, set_gr) = grammar_family to_str name in

   ... code using grammars of gr to define mutually recursive grammars ...
   ... the grammars in gr cannot be used in "left position" ...
   ... (same restriction as for declare_grammar ...

   (* Define the grammar family *)
   let _ = set_gr the_grammars

   ... now the new family can be used ...
   ]}
*)

(** allows to rename a grammar *)
val give_name : string -> 'a grammar -> 'a grammar
