PaComb: an efficient parsing library for OCaml
==============================================

PaComb implements a representation of grammars with semantic actions (values
returned as a result of parsing). Parsing is performed by compiling grammars
defined with the `Grammar` module (or indirectly though a PPX extension) to
the combinators of the `Combinator` module. The library offers _scanner less_
parsing, but the `Lex` module provide a notion of _terminals_ and _blanks_
that give a simple way to write grammars in two phases, as usual.

The main advantage of PaComb and similar solutions, contrary to ocamlyacc, is
that grammars (compiled or not) are __first class values__. This allows using
the full power of OCaml for manipulating grammars. For example, this is very
useful when working with syntax extension mechanisms.

Importantly, the __performances__ of PaComb are very good: it is only two to
five times slower than grammars generated by ocamlyacc, which is a compiler.

Defining languages using the `Grammar` module directly is cumbersome. For that
reason, PaComb provides a BNF-like PPX syntax extension (enabled using the
`-ppx pacombPpx` compilation flag). An example with arithmetic expressions is
