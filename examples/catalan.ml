   define two ambiguous grammars parsing sequences of characters to generate all
   binary trees and ternary trees. *)


(* A parser parsing arbitrary sequence of charaters 'a' as a set of binary
   trees. We use merge in case of ambiguity and pacomb keep sharing when we
   parse twice the same part of the input (@merge implies @cache). We just return
   the number of tree. *)
